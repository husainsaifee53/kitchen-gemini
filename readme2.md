Build the "Fridge Feast AI" MVP**

#### ## Project Goal
Create a single-page web application named "Fridge Feast AI" that allows a user to enter a list of on-hand ingredients and receive immediate recipe suggestions generated by the Gemini AI.

***

#### ## Core User Story
"As a busy person who wants to save money and reduce food waste, I need a quick way to see what meals I can make with the ingredients I already have in my kitchen, so I can get instant, creative cooking ideas without extensive searching."

***

#### ## MVP Core Features
1.  *Ingredient Input:* A single, clear text input field where the user can type a comma-separated list of their available ingredients.
2.  *Generate Button:* A prominent button labeled "Find Recipes!" that, when clicked, sends the user's ingredient list to the backend.
3.  *Secure Backend Logic:* A serverless function that receives the ingredient list, securely attaches the Gemini API key, and sends a precisely formatted prompt to the Gemini API.
4.  *Recipe Display:* A clean and readable section on the page that displays the formatted recipes received from the Gemini API.

***

#### ## The AI Prompt (The "Secret Sauce")
The following prompt must be sent to the Gemini API by the serverless function:
> You are "Chef Gemini," a creative and practical culinary assistant. Your goal is to help users create delicious meals with the ingredients they already have, reducing food waste. You will be given a list of ingredients. Based only on those ingredients (and common pantry staples like oil, salt, pepper, and water), you must generate *2 distinct recipe ideas. For each recipe, you must provide a catchy **Recipe Name, an estimated **Cooking Time, a list of the **Ingredients Used, and simple, **Step-by-Step Instructions*. Format your entire response in clean Markdown.

***

#### ## Recommended Tech Stack (for a 2-Hour Hackathon)
* *Frontend:* HTML, CSS,tailwind, and Vanilla JavaScript.
* *Backend:* A Serverless Function deployed on *Vercel* or *Netlify. or **supbase* ., itmust work that it .



* *API:* Google AI's Gemini API.
